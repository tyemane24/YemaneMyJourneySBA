SBA-3 webpages 

Attached is a zip file containing a website I built for a class project. It consists of three webpages- an index page, an about page, and a contact page.
The website is designed to be for a web application that allows users to log and document their travel experiences.  Since the project was mostly designed for me to showcase my knowledge and understanding of layouts, CSS, and Javascript functions rather than logistics of the application, I have used a lot of filler text.
